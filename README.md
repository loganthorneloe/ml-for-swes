# ML for SWEs Repo

This repository contains the code for the projects featured in the "Machine learning for Software Engineers" newsletter. Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different project, each providing a hands-on guide to building AI.

Accompanying articles explaining these systems, their impact, and step-by-step tutorials can be found at mlforswes.com. [Subscribe](https://mlforswes.com/subscribe) to get them right in your inbox. I'll be adding more systems over time.
