                        Why learn ML from first principles?

                    <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Understanding first principles is crucial for building robust ML systems. It helps you debug issues effectively, make informed architectural decisions, and adapt to new developments in the field. While you can use ML libraries without understanding the fundamentals, the most effective engineers know what's happening under the hood. This knowledge is what separates those who can merely use ML from those who can build production-ready systems.</p>

                        <p>No, I didn't create all the resources. Instead, I've carefully vetted and organized existing high-quality resources into a logical learning path specifically designed for software engineers.
